pakku.conf - pakku configuration file

Synopsis

Description

This configuration file uses a similar format to pacman.conf. The file is
divided into sections. Only options section is used.

Options
-------
*UserCacheDir =* path/to/user/cache/dir::
	Set the cache directory in which pakku will cache repositories.
	The default value is +$\{HOME\}/.cache/pakku+.

*TmpDir =* path/to/tmp/dir::
	Set the temporary directory in which pakku will perform all
	building operations. The default value is +/tmp/pakku-$\{USER\}+.

*AurRepo =* name::
	Set the fake AUR repository name. This name should not conflict with
	names of declared repositories. The default value is +aur+.

*AurComments*::
	Download and display comments for AUR packages.

*CheckIgnored*::
	Check ignored packages for updates in AUR. Pakku will be able to warn
	about ignored package upgrade.

*IgnoreArch*::
	Ignore a missing or incomplete arch field in the build script. Pakku
	will pass '\--ignorearch' option to linkman:makepkg[8].

*PrintAurNotFound*::
	Print warnings during upgrade operation when foreign packages were not
	found in AUR.

*PrintLocalIsNewer*::
	Print warnings during upgrade operation when local packages are newer
	than those found in remote repositories.

*SudoExec*::
	Automatically exec the program from root via sudo if it is necessary,
	allowing you to enter password for sudo only once.

*ViewNoDefault*::
	When building from AUR, pakku will ask whether you want to view the
	content of PKGBUILD and other files. Pressing enter key will give the
	positive answer unless this option is specified.

*PreserveBuilt =* Internal | User | Disabled::
	If set to Internal, built packages will be copied to pacman cache dir.
	If set to User, built packages will be copied to UserCacheDir.
	If set to Disabled (the default), built packages will not be preserved.

*PreBuildCommand =* command::
	This command will be executed in package directory before building,
	allowing you to modify PKGBUILD or perform other necessary actions.

*PreferredSudoCommand =* command::
	This is the command that will be used to escalate priviliges. If the option is
	not set or the command is not found on the system, pakku will try to guess the
	command between sudo, doas and su.
