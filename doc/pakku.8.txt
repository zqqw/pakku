pakku(8)
========

Name
----
pakku - package manager utility wrapper

Synopsis
--------
'pakku' <operation> [options] [targets]

Description
-----------
Pakku is a pacman wrapper with additional features, such as AUR support.

Operations and Options
----------------------
Pakku provides all operations and options from pacman. This page will focus
on pakku-specific options only. See linkman:pacman[8] for additional
information.

Query Options (apply to '-Q')[[QO]]
-----------------------------------
*-t, \--unrequired*::
	Specify this option thrice combining with '-d' to list dependencies
	which are not required by any explicitly installed package.

Sync Options (apply to '-S')[[SO]]
----------------------------------
*-n, \--build*::
	Build packages from source. Building is supported for directly specified
	packages only, so it will not work for package groups or virtual packages.
	Package version can be given. IgnorePkg in /etc/pacman.conf can be used to
	avoid downgrades being overwritten on updates. Caution, other versions may
	not always build or function correctly without more changes: +
	pakku -Sn less=1:581.2-1

*\--keyserver* <name>::
	Use name as keyserver to receive keys from.

*\--noaur*::
	Disable AUR support. This option is assumed when you use non-standard
	root path or run the program from root.

*-z, \--source*::
	Retrieve PKGBUILD source. Version can be specified as with -n above.
	You can specify destination directory after package name: +
	pakku -Sz bash::/tmp/bash

Configuration
-------------
See linkman:pacman.conf[5] and linkman:pakku.conf[5] for details on configuring
the program.
